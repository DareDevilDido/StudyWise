    "long_summary": "Software Design Principles\n\nIntroduction\nDr. Mostafa Elgendy\nMostafa. Modeling and Documenting SW Architecture and SW\nDesign. -Feb- SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES Main Activities of many Industries\n Each, and every industry worldwide has six main activities that\nthat should be accomplished. These tasks are being accomplished as part of what is\ncalled Planning Activity. -Feb- SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES Main Activities of many Industries\n When both parties finally agree on all requirements, Boeing should pass the\nagreed specifications to the manufacturing team. -Feb- SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES Main Activities of many Industries\nBOEING -ER (Seats )\n-Feb- SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES Main Activities of many Industries\n The same plane type that comes with same subtype can\nhave multiple designs with similar predefined architecture. Previous Figures showed the architecture and internal\ndesign of the Boeing -ER that are being built for the\nfavor of three different Airline customers. To do this, the plane should be painted with the theme, and logo\nof the customer Airline. Finally, a crew flies by the plane to be deployed into the\ncustomers airport. This mapping is important to grown the belief that\narchitecture and design are core activities in any product\ndevelopment process. Types of Designer roles\n Types of Designer roles. Both of\nthose decisions are key pillar in finishing the SW\nfinal blueprintdesign. -Feb- MOBILE PROGRAMMING Defining SW design and architecture\n Design vs. Architecture ()\n Design Decisions are mostly concerned with fulfilling the Functional\nrequirements. -Feb- MOBILE PROGRAMMING Defining SW design and architecture\n Types of Architect Roles ()\n Application architect. Applications architect is the ones who define how the application will be\nstructured coding-wise. Usually, the server is a database with\nServer\napplication logic represented as stored procedures. Component-Based Decomposes application design into reusable functional or logical\ncomponents that expose well-defined communication interfaces. -Feb- MOBILE PROGRAMMING Defining SW design and architecture\n Order of architecture  design within the SW\ndevelopment lifecycle ()\n Most of the required information by Architect and Designer are\nRequirements that come from Analysis, and scoping constraints that\ncome from Planning. In waterfall process model, Architecture, and design comes after\nAnalysis. For OO, development, UML is the documentation standard\n-Feb- MOBILE PROGRAMMING Summary\n The Importance of Design and Architecture in the industrial process."
