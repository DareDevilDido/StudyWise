    "long_summary": "- Course covers various topics in software design principles\n- Grade distribution includes attendance, participation, exams, and labs\n- Importance of design and architecture in industrial processes discussed\n- Software development as an industry explored\n- Main activities common to many industries: planning, requirements analysis, architecture and design, build, test, deliver/deploy\n- Example using plane production industry to illustrate industry activities\n- Feasibility of production projects determined based on various factors\n- Importance of defining project scope for successful completion of project - Boeing gathering requirements from Egypt Air for a plane, including material, seat types, spacing, and seat features\n- Requirements analysis activity involved in this process\n- Agreed specifications passed to manufacturing team for plane production\n- Blueprint detailing product architecture and design essential for production\n- Multiple designs of Boeing 777-300ER for different airlines based on same architecture\n- Product development activity ends with producing the plane\n- Testing activity to ensure plane meets required standards\n- Product deployment involves preparing plane with customer theme and logo for deployment\n- Software development projects typically involve these six main activities\n- Software industry recognized by US and Japan, emphasizing importance of architecture and design\n- SW design starts with understanding customer requirements and user tasks. - Types of Designer Roles:\n  - User Interface (UI) designer\n  - User Interface (UI) designer\n- Order of architecture & design within SW development lifecycle:\n  - Design decisions focus on fulfilling Functional Requirements\n  - Architecture decisions focus on Non-Functional Requirements\n- SW Architecture:\n  - Defines the high-level concept of a system\n  - Involves significant components interacting through interfaces\n- Architecture Design:\n  - Performed by an architect\n  - Concerned with application quality attributes and nonfunctional requirements\n- Some Example Architecture Decisions:\n  - Platform, operating system, programming language\n  - User experience technology, component messaging\n- Types of Architect Roles:\n  - Application architect\n  - Infrastructure architect - Application architect focuses on structuring the application's code and making key decisions affecting development.\n- Decisions include OS, DBMS, UI types, platform, coding language, user interface tech, and client devices.\n- Architecture styles for application architect include Client/Server, Component-Based, Layered, Message Bus, N-Tiers, and Service Oriented.\n- Infrastructure architect defines physical deployment of components and layers on hardware and network.\n- Designer roles include UI designer, application domain designer, and data designer. - Types of designer roles in software design and architecture:\n   - Application domain designer: focuses on business rules and domain objects\n   - Data designer: designs application databases\n- Order of architecture & design in the software development lifecycle:\n   - In waterfall model, follows analysis stage\n   - In agile iterative processes, may flow back to analysis\n- Importance of documenting design decisions for implementation and maintainability\n- Use of UML for documenting object-oriented development\n- Emphasis on the significance of design and architecture in software development industry"
