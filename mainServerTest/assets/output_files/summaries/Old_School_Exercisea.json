    "long_summary": "The deep knee bend is an old-school bodyweight squat variation where the heels are elevated to increase knee flexion and target the quadriceps. It has a long history of use among athletes and coaches for building strong, resilient legs. The deep knee bend concentrates stress on the knee connective tissue, which adapts and strengthens with gradual training. It is primarily a conditioning exercise, best for building endurance rather than maximal strength. Sets of 50-100 reps a few times per week can create fatigue-resistant legs ideal for activities like hiking and cycling. While deep knee bends can build muscle, especially in the quads, they are not the most efficient tool for hypertrophy training. Overall, the deep knee bend is an accessible exercise with proven benefits for joint resilience and lower body endurance."
