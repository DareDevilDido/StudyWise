Attitude• “If you freeze an idea too quickly, you
fall in love with it.
• If you refine it too quickly, you
become attached to it and it
becomes very hard to keep exploring,
To Keep Looking for Better.
• The crudeness of the early models in
particular is very deliberate.
Jim Glymph, Gehry PartnersPrototype's role in the design profession
• Prototypes do play a role in pre-implementation visualization and
testing.
• But they also play another very important role: that of a tool of
inquiry.
• In this sense they serve as thinking aids for exploring new
possibilities.
• They help us develop a better understanding of what could be.it is important to think
through a number of basic
business model possibilities
before developing a business
case for a specific model.“Spirit of Inquiry” is called
design attitude, because it is
Spirit of Inquiry
so central to the design

ScalesPrototypes at Different Scales
A business model prototype can be anything from a rough sketch
of an idea on a napkin to a detailed Business Model Canvas to a
field-testable business model.
It’s about exploring new and perhaps silly, even impossible ideas
by adding and removing elements of each prototype. You can
experiment with prototypes at different levels.Business Model Prototyping
• Business model prototyping is about a mindset we call “design
attitude.”
• It stands for an uncompromising commitment to discovering
new and better business models by sketching out many
prototypes — —representing many strategic

6. Scenarios.StorytellingStorytelling
• In our daily life as parents, as colleagues, and as friends, we are
telling stories, but actually …….
we avoid as businesspeople using stories in our roles
.
Storytelling is an undervalued and underused art
in the world of business.Why Storytelling?
• By their nature, new or innovative business models can be difficult
to describe and understand as they challenge the status quo by
arranging things in unfamiliar ways.
• They force listeners to open their minds to new possibilities.
• Resistance is one likely reaction to an unfamiliar model.
• Therefore, describing new business models in a way that overcomes
resistance is crucial.1 2 3
Why
Storytelling? Introducing Pitching to Engaging
the New. Investors EmployeesWhy Storytelling?
(1) Introducing the New.
• Ultimately, managers are interested in numbers and facts,
but having the right story can win their attention.
• A good story is a compelling way to quickly outline a broad idea
before getting caught up in the details.Why Storytelling?
(2) Pitching to Investors.
What investors and other shareholders want to know is:
• How will you create value for customers?
• How will you make money doing so?
That’s the perfect setting for a story.
It’s the ideal way to introduce your venture and business model
before getting into the full business plan.Why Storytelling?
(3) Engaging Employees.
When an organization transitions from an existing business model to a
new business model,
• organization needs to powerfully engage its employees and
convince collaborators to follow.
• People need a crystal-clear understanding of the new model and
what it means for them.Why Storytelling?
(3) Engaging Employees.
That is where traditional text-based PowerPoint
presentations usually fail.Why Storytelling?
(3) Engaging Employees.
• People are moved more by stories than by logic.
• Introducing a new business model through an engaging story-
based presentation (delivered with PowerPoint, drawings, or
other techniques) is far more likely to connect with listeners.Why Storytelling?
(3) Engaging Employees.
• Capturing people’s attention and curiosity opens the way for
in-depth presentations and discussions of the unfamiliar.Making Business Models Tangible?
• The goal of telling a story is to introduce a new business model
in an engaging, tangible way.
• Keep the story simple and use only one protagonist (hero).
• Depending on the audience, you can use a different protagonist
with a different perspective.Storytelling possible starting points

• Explain the business model in the form of a story told from an
employee’s perspective.
• Use the employee as the protagonist who demonstrates why
the new model makes sense
• Either to solve customer problems or makes better or different
use of resources, activities, or partnerships.Storytelling possible starting points
• Cast a customer as the protagonist and tell the tale from her
point of view.
• Show the challenges customer faces & which jobs must get
done, then outline how your organization creates value for her.
• Add some drama and emotion to the story and describe how
your organization is making her life easier.• The biggest challenge with stories told from a customer
perspective is keeping them authentic and avoiding a facile or
patronizing tone.Storytelling TechniquesStorytelling TechniquesStorytelling TechniquesStorytelling TechniquesStorytelling TechniquesStorytelling TechniquesGroup Homework.
