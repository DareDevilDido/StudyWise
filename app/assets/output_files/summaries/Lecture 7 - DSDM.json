DSDM teams work towards achieving\nprojects that align with greater business objectives and exist within\nparameters that make sense for the business. Core principles of DSDM\n Maintain high quality. Teams implement feedback promptly and adapt\nto ongoing changes in a project's specifications and needs. The focus on iterative development\nmay allow professionals to revisit their work to infuse more unique,\ncreative elements later. You can implement more\nstructure in your team before committing to DSDM to ensure its\nsuccess. Business study\n Once you know the project is technically possible, research the\nproject from a business perspective. A new functional area was discovered, so return to business study phase and\nrepeat the whole process. LEAN (Kanban)\n LEAN : Lean\ndevelopment practices\nare based on the Lean\nmethodologies that\nhave been used\nsuccessfully in\nmanufacturing\nprocesses. Principle : Respect the Current Process, Roles  Responsibilities. The columns on the card wall represent different states or\nsteps in the workflow. The critical\nelements are that work-in-process at each state in the workflow is limited and that new work is\npulled into the new information discovery activity when there is available capacity within the\nlocal WIP limit. Manage Flow\nEach transition between states in the workflow is monitored, measured and reported. Improve Collaboratively\nThe way to achieve continuous improvement and sustainable change within an organization is\nthrough shared vision of a better future and collective understanding of the issues that need to be\novercome..The Positive and Negative Side of Kanban\nPositive Side\nNegative side\n. Lack of timing is another disadvantage because\n."
