    "long_summary": "- Speech to text converts audio data into machine readable text\n- Deep speech is an open source speech to text system that uses a neural network\n- Deep speech is based on Baidu's research paper\n- Deep speech has an acoustic model and a language model\n- The acoustic model is an end-to-end deep learning system\n- The language model improves the accuracy of the transcription output\n- The PBMM file is the acoustic model trained on American English\n- The scorer file is the language model\n- The PBMM file is memory efficient and fast to load\n- There is a TF lite version available for low power devices\n- The language model helps determine the correct word in context\n- Sample audio files are downloaded for testing purposes\n- The PBMM and scorer files are imported from the deep speech model package. - The text mentions importing numpy for buffering audio files and importing ipython.display for playing audio in the Jupyter browser.\n- It refers to two file paths: one for the acoustic model and one for the language model.\n- The parameters alpha, beta, and beam width are mentioned, with a suggestion to adjust them based on the data.\n- Custom training a language model is suggested for better understanding of domain-specific vocabulary.\n- Two steps are mentioned in which the model and language model are loaded and the parameters are set.\n- A function is created to open a wave file, get the frame rate, and check the number of frames.\n- Batch mode is mentioned for transcription of the entire audio file at once. - Streaming mode allows for reading and printing audio file frames as conversion happens\n- The first function reads the audio file frames and returns the buffer and rate\n- The second function uses the buffer to transcribe the audio using a model\n- Two audio files are downloaded and transcribed using the transcribe function\n- The first file's transcription is \"Why should one all the way\"\n- The second file's transcription is \"Administer medicine to animal is frequently a very difficult matter, and yet sometimes it's necessary to do so\"\n- A shorter file is downloaded and transcribed as well - Real world files may contain background noise and cross talk\n- It is important to train the model to handle cross talk and noise\n- Challenges can be addressed by training the acoustic model with more data\n- Training can be done from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing model."
