ESIWYDUTSINTRODUCTI ON
StudyWise is a smart and versatile
tutoring platform that
accommodates both textual and
video-based learning materials. It
incorporates the use of a chatbot to
aid text-based material, and
several technologies to help make
lecture videos a lot more
interactive. StudyWise aims to
make the process of studying and
4
learning more engaging and
effective, giving users a clear
indicator of progress to keep them on
track.
ESIWYDUTSBUSI NESS M OTI VATION
• The growing demand for smart tutoring systems
and personalized learning experiences
• Facilitating adaptive learning to fit different needs, even
beyond academic (learning & growing skills)
• Possible revenue through subscription-based plans and
advertising opportunities
5
ESIWYDUTSAC ADEMIC M OTIVATI ON
• Helping students study more effectively
• Helping keep track of the learning journey
• Lack of involvement in traditional studying methods
• Cutting costs by using adaptive tutoring techniques
6
ESIWYDUTSPROBL EM STATEMENT
•
Diversity of among learners and their abilities
• Students often face difficulty managing their time
•
Planning study sessions can take more time than desired
• Wordiness or complexity of study material
• Maintaining focus throughout long lectures can be challenging
7
ESIWYDUTSPO SSIBL E CH ALL ENG ES
• Data Extraction: Highly effective parsing methods needed to achieve
consistent
satisfactory results with various content formats (images, text-based
documents).
• Understanding the Content: Understanding the meaning of the information
that’s been extracted can be very challenging. NLP techniques and machine
learning models need to be employed efficiently to handle the textual content
identify the key word and relate them to the user’s queries.
• Structural variations: Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoints and videos have
different structures. Our system must be able to handle these structural
variations to extract relevant information consistently
• Content Updates: Resources can undergo updates or new versions. Chatbots
should be able to handle version control, track changes, and provide up-to-
date and relevant information to users.
8
• Visual Content Interpretation: Extracting information from visual elements
like images, charts, or diagrams is going to be challenging. Chatbots will need
techniques like optical character recognition (OCR) or image analysis to
interpret visual content and provide relevant insights.

STAKEHO LD ER S
• Students are the main focus and primary users of StudyWise.
They will upload educational resources, receive tutoring on the
resources they provide, and track their progress
• Parents/Guardians of students can play a crucial role in their
education. They can be engaged in the decision-making process
and monitoring their child’s progress
• Schools, colleges, and educational institutions could be
external stakeholders if they engage with StudyWise. These
institutions can partner with the platform or recommend it to the
students.
• Administrators and educational professionals, such as school
principals or academic advisors may have an interest in
9
StudyWise. They could be involved in decision-making processes,
evaluation of the system, or integration into the general
educational framework.
• Funding organizations or investors can become external
stakeholders if StudyWise requires investment
ESIWYDUTSSI M IL AR SYSTEM S
• The VideoPoints project • ChatPDF • Mindgrasp
10
ESIWYDUTS(1 ) VI DEOPOINTS
• This project turns video lectures or
instructional videos into a sequence of
topical segments.
• It utilizes OCR in an algorithm to determine
dominant keywords from the videos’
frames and links them with their
corresponding video segments for easy
navigation.
11
ESIWYDUTS(2 ) CHATPDF
• Summarize information included in PDF files to aid in
comprehension
• Answer questions about text included in a PDF file.
•
Analyze documents to aid in the
quick extraction of information
• Interpret and translate PDF files in
any language.
12
ESIWYDUTS(3 ) M IND GRASP
• Like ChatPDF, Mindgrasp allows you to ask questions about a
document and get clear, easy-to-understand answers
• Its AI can identify knowledge gaps
and provide targeted remediation
• Encourages more interaction
through quizzes, challenges, and
rewards
