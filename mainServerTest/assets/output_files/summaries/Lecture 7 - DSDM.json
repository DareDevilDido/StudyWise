    "long": "- DSDM is a rapid application development method in the UK\n- Focuses on fixing time and resources, adjusting functionality accordingly\n- Core principles include focusing on business needs, delivering on time, collaborating, maintaining quality, building incrementally, developing iteratively, communicating continuously, and demonstrating control\n- Disadvantages include limiting creativity and requiring a reliable structure for successful implementation\n- The DSDM lifecycle involves five major phases: feasibility, business study, functional model iteration, design and build. - Implementation phase:\n  - Review project specifications for feasibility\n  - Ensure goals can be met within budget, timeline, and technology\n- Business study phase:\n  - Research project from a business perspective\n  - Evaluate alignment with organization goals, competition, and user needs\n- Functional model iteration phase:\n  - Build and test prototype based on specifications\n- Design and build phase:\n  - Refine prototype for efficiency and address issues\n  - Test product for responsiveness and ease of use\n- Implementation phase:\n  - Release project for operational use and gather user feedback\n  - Determine if adjustments are needed based on user feedback\n- Lifecycle roles:\n  - Business Sponsor, Business Visionary, Project Manager, Technical Coordinator, Business Analyst, Technical Advisor, Business Advisor, Team Leader, Solution Developer, Solution Tester, Workshop Facilitator, DSDM Coach\n- LEAN (Kanban):\n  - Lean development practices based on successful manufacturing methods\n- Kanban principles:\n  - Start with what is needed now, incremental change, respect current process, encourage leadership at all levels. - Visualize the Workflow:\n  - Helps understand planned changes and implement them accordingly\n  - Card wall with columns representing workflow steps is common visualization method\n  \n- Limit Work in Progress:\n  - Implements a pull system in workflow\n  - Using kanban system helps implement pull system\n  - Work-in-process is limited at each state in the workflow\n\n- Manage Flow:\n  - Monitor, measure, and report transitions between workflow states\n  - Evaluates changes to system effects\n\n- Make Process Policies Explicit:\n  - Discuss and improve processes effectively\n  - Move discussions from emotional to rational, empirical\n\n- Feedback Loops:\n  - Encourages small incremental changes\n  - Teams measure effectiveness through tracking various metrics\n\n- Improve Collaboratively:\n  - Achieve sustainable change through shared vision and understanding\n\nPositive Side of Kanban:\n- Everyone on the same page\n- Reveals bottlenecks in workflow\n- Brings flexibility\n- Team more responsive\n- Easy access for remote team members\n- Flow analytics\n\nNegative Side of Kanban:\n- Outdated board can lead to issues\n- Overcomplicating the board\n- Lack of timing associated with phases"
