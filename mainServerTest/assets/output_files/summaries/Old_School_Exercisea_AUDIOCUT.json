    "long_summary": "\n Here is a long summary of the transcript:\n\nThe deep knee bend is an old-school bodyweight squat variation with the heels elevated to target the quadriceps. It has a long history of use among athletes and coaches to build strong, resilient legs. The knees-over-toes position loads the knee connective tissue more than a regular squat, but this isn't dangerous as long as volume is built up gradually. Deep knee bends are primarily a conditioning exercise rather than for maximal strength development. They can be very effective for building endurance for activities like hiking, cycling, and running. Sets of 50-100 reps a few times per week are recommended, using constant tension and not locking out at the top. While deep knee bends can build muscle, very high reps make them less efficient for hypertrophy than other exercises. But they do have a track record for building bigger quads with sufficient volume. Overall, deep knee bends are an accessible exercise that can bulletproof knees and legs for endurance activities, as well as potentially add some quad size, by progressing volume carefully over time. The history of use among athletes and coaches speaks to their effectiveness when programmed appropriately."
