    "long_summary": "- Views and viewpoints are essential for understanding complex architectural structures\n- Views structure architectural descriptions into different aspects of the system\n- Viewpoints offer guidance for creating each view, similar to the object-class relationship\n- Viewpoints have roots from academics such as David Parnas, Dewayne Perry, and Alex Wolf\n- Sample sets of viewpoints include those by Philippe Kruchten, RM-ODP, and Christine Hofmeister\n- These viewpoints provide structure and guidance for architectural descriptions\n- \"Applied Software Architecture\" book by Jeff Garland and Richard Anthony discusses the viewpoints set\n- Online link for the book \"Large Scale Software Architecture\": https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/Large_Scale_Software_Architecture/oQLLSqZC?hl=en&gbpv=d&ql=large+scale+software+architecture#v=onepage&q&f=false\n- \"Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives\" by Eoin Woods et al defines a smaller set of viewpoints than Garland and Anthony's\n- Online link for the book \"Software Systems Architecture\": https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/Software_Systems_Architecture/kaQOkXQFuCkC?hl=en&gbpv=d&q=Software+Systems+Architecture:+Working+With+Stakeholders+Using+Viewpoints+and+Perspectives&printsec=frontcover\n- ISO Standard and its development from the previous IEEE Standard relate to conceptual models on viewpoints and views\n- Online link for the ISO Standard: https://www.iso.org/standard.html , http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-cm"
