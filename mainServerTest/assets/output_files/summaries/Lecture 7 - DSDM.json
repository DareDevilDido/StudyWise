    "long": "- DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) is a leading framework for rapid application development in the UK.\n- Core principles of DSDM include focusing on business needs, delivering projects on time, collaborating, maintaining high quality, building incrementally, developing iteratively, continuous communication, and demonstrating control.\n- Disadvantages of DSDM include minimizing creativity by encouraging quick work and demanding a reliable structure and support from management.\n- The DSDM lifecycle typically includes five major phases: feasibility, business study, functional model iteration, and design and build. - Implementation Feasibility:\n  - Review project specifications for realism\n  - Consider budget, timeline, and technology\n- Business Study:\n  - Research project from a business perspective\n  - Align with organizational objectives\n  - Compete effectively in industry\n  - Meet user needs\n- Functional Model Iteration:\n  - Build prototype meeting specifications\n  - Test and evaluate prototype\n  - Iterate until effective prototype\n- Design and Build:\n  - Refine prototype for efficiency\n  - Design additional components\n  - Test product for responsiveness and usability\n- Implementation:\n  - Release project into operational environment\n  - Collect user feedback\n  - Assess for completion or new challenges\n  - Return to previous stage based on feedback\n- Possibilities at End of Implementation Phase:\n  - User demand met, no further development needed\n  - New functional area discovered, return to business study\n  - Missed essential part, return to functional model iteration\n  - Non-functional requirement not satisfied, return to design and build\n- Lifecycle Roles:\n  - Business Sponsor, Business Visionary, Project Manager, Technical Coordinator, Business Analyst, Technical Advisor, Business Advisor, Team Leader, Solution Developer, Solution Tester, Workshop Facilitator, DSDM Coach\n- LEAN (Kanban):\n  - Lean development practices based on successful manufacturing methodologies\n  - Kanban method for managing knowledge work with just-in-time delivery\n  - Incremental, evolutionary process and systems change\n  - Kanban board principles and practices - Visualizing the Workflow\n  - Supports understanding of planned changes\n  - Implemented through card wall with columns for different states\n- Limit Work in Progress\n  - Implement pull system\n  - Work-in-process limited at each state in the workflow\n- Manage Flow\n  - Monitor, measure, and report transitions between states\n  - Evaluate changes' effects on the system\n- Make Process Policies Explicit\n  - Necessary for improvement discussions\n  - Enables rational, objective problem-solving\n- Feedback Loops\n  - Encourages small, continuous, evolutionary changes\n  - Teams measure effectiveness through various metrics\n- Improve Collaboratively\n  - Achieve continuous improvement through shared vision\n- Positive Side of Kanban\n  - Everyone on the same page\n  - Kanban reveals bottlenecks\n  - Brings flexibility and responsiveness\n- Negative Side of Kanban\n  - Outdated board can lead to issues\n  - Team may overcomplicate board\n  - Lack of timing and timeframes\n  - Focus on finishing work may lack in collaboration and productivity."
