        "back": "In the context of moving, variables are compared to boxes that hold different items and are labeled for easy identification and retrieval."

        "front": "Why is it important to choose meaningful names for variables?",
        "back": "Choosing meaningful names for variables is important because it helps in easily identifying the purpose and use of the variable in the program."

        "front": "What is the purpose of declaring a variable in programming?",
        "back": "Declaring a variable in programming is the process of creating a storage location with an assigned name that can hold data of a specific type and be modified or updated later on."
    },
    {
        "front": "What is a data type and why is it important for variables?",
        "back": "A data type in programming describes the type of data that a variable can hold. It is essential for variables as it determines the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated."
    },
    {
        "front": "Can a variable be declared without assigning it a value?",
        "back": "Yes, a variable can be declared without assigning it a value, in which case it will be an empty container waiting to hold data."
    },
    {
        "front": "What are some common data types in programming languages like Java?",
        "back": "Common data types in Java include integer, character, byte, string, short, long, boolean, double, and float, each serving specific purposes and holding specific types of data."
    },
    {
        "front": "How would you change the value of a variable in a program?",
        "back": "The value of a variable can be changed by assigning it a new value using the variable's name followed by the assignment operator, such as variableName = newValue."
    },
    {
        "front": "Why is it important to match the data type of a variable with the values being stored in it?",
        "back": "Matching the data type of a variable with the values being stored ensures accurate data representation and prevents errors that may occur when incompatible data is assigned to a variable."
    },
    {
        "front": "How does the metaphor of packing boxes relate to the concept of variables?",
        "back": "The metaphor of packing boxes helps in understanding variables as storage locations with names that hold different types of data, which can be modified or replaced just like items in boxes."
