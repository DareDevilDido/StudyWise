        "front": "What is the deep knee bend and how does it differ from a regular bodyweight squat?",
        "back": "The deep knee bend is a variation of the bodyweight squat done with the heels elevated, pushing the knees further over the toes to concentrate stress on the quads."
    },
    {
        "front": "What is the benefit of elevating the heels during the deep knee bend?",
        "back": "Elevating the heels during the deep knee bend loads the connective tissue of the knees to a greater degree, helping to strengthen the knees over time."
    },
    {
        "front": "How can one avoid injury when performing deep knee bends?",
        "back": "To avoid injury when performing deep knee bends, it is important to slowly build up intensity and volume to ensure the connective tissue adapts and gets stronger over time."

    {
        "front": "What is the recommended set and rep range for deep knee bends for building resilient legs?",
        "back": "It is recommended to work up to two to three sets of 50 to 100 repetitions, performing constant tension style without locking out at the top, to build resilient legs."
    },
    {
        "front": "Is the deep knee bend primarily a conditioning exercise or a muscle-building exercise?",
        "back": "The deep knee bend is primarily a conditioning exercise, but it can still build muscle. However, higher reps are less effective for muscle building, requiring more total sets for growth."
    },
    {
        "front": "What type of athletes in the past have used the deep knee bend as a staple exercise?",
        "back": "Some of the greatest physical culturists in the past, as well as combat athletes like indian wrestlers, have used the deep knee bend as a staple exercise in their training."

    {
        "front": "Why is a barbell squat considered a better tool for maximum strength compared to deep knee bends?",
        "back": "A barbell squat is considered a better tool for maximum strength compared to deep knee bends because of the greater loading potential and mechanics involved in the exercise."

    {
        "front": "What are some lower body endurance activities that can benefit from incorporating deep knee bends?",
        "back": "Activities like backpacking, hiking, rucking, road cycling, mountain biking, skiing, running, and other lower body endurance activities can benefit from incorporating deep knee bends for increased work capacity."
